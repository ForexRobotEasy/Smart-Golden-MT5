## Functionality
The Smart Golden MT5 forex robot code consists of several functions to implement the scalping strategy, manage risk, analyze historical data, and execute orders. Here is a breakdown of the main functions:

### Initialization
- The `OnInit()` function is called during the robot's initialization process.
- It checks if the special price period has ended based on the number of orders.
- If the special price period has ended, it sets the regular price.
- If the special price period is still active, it displays the special price for the first ten sales.

### Price Change Analysis
- The `PriceChangeAnalysis()` function is responsible for analyzing and identifying small price changes in the gold market.
- This code is not provided in the sample, as it depends on the specific AI techniques used by the Smart Golden MT5 robot.

### Order Execution
- The `OrderExecution()` function executes orders based on the scalping strategy.
- This code is not provided in the sample, as it depends on the specific trading logic implemented by the Smart Golden MT5 robot.

### Risk Management
- The `RiskManagement()` function manages risk and prevents excessive drawdowns.
- This code is not provided in the sample, as it depends on the specific risk management techniques used by the Smart Golden MT5 robot.

### Historical Data Analysis
- The `HistoricalDataAnalysis()` function extracts robust characteristics from historical gold data.
- This code is not provided in the sample, as it depends on the specific AI techniques used by the Smart Golden MT5 robot.

### System Encoding
- The `SystemEncoding()` function encodes the extracted characteristics into the system.
- This code is not provided in the sample, as it depends on the specific AI techniques used by the Smart Golden MT5 robot.

### Backtesting and Maximum Drawdown (MDD)
- The `BacktestMDD()` function backtests the system and checks for the maximum drawdown (MDD).
- It calls the `CalculateMaxDrawdown()` function to calculate the maximum drawdown during backtesting.
- If the calculated drawdown is within the allowed limit, it prints a message indicating a successful backtest.
- If the calculated drawdown exceeds the allowed limit, it prints a message indicating a failed backtest.

### Entry Point and Trading
- The `OnTick()` function serves as the entry point of the program.
- It calls the necessary functions in the specified order: `PriceChangeAnalysis()`, `OrderExecution()`, `RiskManagement()`, `HistoricalDataAnalysis()`, and `SystemEncoding()`.
- It then checks the backtest results using `BacktestMDD()` and proceeds with trading or handles excessive drawdowns accordingly.

## Product Description
Smart Golden MT5 is an advanced forex robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is specifically designed for trading in the gold market, utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance trading performance.

This powerful tool is capable of analyzing small price changes in the gold market to identify profitable trading opportunities. It executes orders based on a scalping strategy, aiming to take advantage of short-term price movements. With robust risk management features, it helps prevent excessive drawdowns and ensures optimal risk control.

Smart Golden MT5 incorporates AI-driven algorithms to extract valuable characteristics from historical gold data. These characteristics are then encoded into the system, enabling the robot to make informed trading decisions based on historical patterns and trends.

Before deploying Smart Golden MT5 in live trading, it is recommended to backtest the system to evaluate its performance. The robot's backtesting process includes calculating the maximum drawdown (MDD), a measure of the largest peak-to-trough decline during historical testing. The backtest results can help assess the robot's performance and determine if it meets the trader's risk tolerance.
